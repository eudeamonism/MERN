# Favorite Place App

I created a destination application using the MERN stack. This application allows users to create, delete, and share their favorite destinations. It has a simple login authentication system that protects user data.

<ul>
  <li>State management with props</li>
  <li>Data access via REST API</li>
  <li>MERN stack</li>
  <li>Custom CSS styles</li>
  <li>Version control with Git</li>
  <li>Location-based search</li>
</ul>
