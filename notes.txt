REACT PORTALS
Why Portal?
Because, if nested it can be lost. It should render at the top.

What do I do to index.html?
Add a new div above root, same info other than id. The name is up to me. This will be where we will portal render to.

What next?
Open component that contains what you want to render.
Store JSX content in a constant. But, you will return something different than before.

Next, import something in that component.
-Make sure you have the
--> npm i react-dom
--> import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ex:

function SideDrawer(props) {
	const content = <aside className="side-drawer">{props.children}</aside>;

	return ReactDOM.createPortal(content, document.getElementById('drawer-hook'));
}

export default SideDrawer;
